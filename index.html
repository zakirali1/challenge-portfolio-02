            <p>I took an interest in coding about 2/3 years ago and wanted to challenge my
                self. Having worked in the tech sector for most of my career, it seemed like
                the next step in working on meaningful and fulfilling projects. The languages
                I started with were mainly python and Javascript, and more recently focusing on
                more JS to streamline my learning. The road to being a self-taught programmer is 
                a very challenging task, having to manage your own motivations and developing understandings
                without a structured curriculum can be tough. Having said that, I am more comfortable 
                now than when I started, and I am realising that its more about consistency than trying to
                put a time limit on when I should know everything there is to know about Javacript.  The very 
                first application I built, like everyone else was a <em><strong>Website!</strong></em> See what i've been upto below.
